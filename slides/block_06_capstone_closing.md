# Designing Analytics Projects

## Block 6: Capstone Preparation & Closing

**Eduardo Arino de la Rubia**
January 12, 2026

## Block 6 Overview

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| Capstone Lifecycle Overview | 25 min |
| Finding & Securing Projects | 25 min |
| Your Assignment: Scenario → Brief | 25 min |
| Closing | 25 min |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the final block of the course. Energy may be lower after a full day. The content is practical (capstone preparation) and motivational (closing). Pace appropriately — not too slow, but allow for reflection.

**Key point:** Everything we've covered leads to the capstone. This block makes that connection explicit.

**Say something like:**
"This is our final block. We're covering four things: the capstone lifecycle so you know what's coming, how to find and secure projects, your assignment that's due Thursday, and then we'll close out the course.

This block is practical. It's about your capstone — the biggest single deliverable in your program. Everything we've covered over the past two days is meant to help you scope that project well."

**Energy check:** This is late in Day 2. If energy seems low, consider starting with a quick stand-up stretch or a brief energizer question.

**Transition:** "Let me start by framing why this matters..."
-->

---

## Why This Matters

Everything in this course points toward one thing:

**Your capstone project.**

This is the largest single deliverable in your program. It's what employers see. It's what you talk about in interviews.

The Analytics Project Brief is your tool to **scope it professionally**.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students may not yet appreciate how important the capstone is for their careers. It's the main portfolio piece they'll reference in job interviews. Employers care about it. Poor scoping leads to poor capstones leads to weak interview stories.

**Key point:** The capstone is career-relevant. Good scoping = good capstone = good interview stories.

**Say something like:**
"Everything in this course points toward one thing: your capstone project.

This isn't just an academic exercise. The capstone is the largest single deliverable in your program. It's what employers see when they review your CV. It's what you'll talk about in interviews for years.

I can tell you from experience as a hiring manager: capstone projects matter. When I interview someone, I ask about their biggest analytical project. The people who can explain it clearly — the problem, the approach, the impact, the challenges — stand out. The people who mumble through a vague description of 'some analysis I did' don't get hired.

The Brief is your tool to scope the capstone professionally. Good scoping leads to good execution leads to good stories in interviews."

**Transition:** "Let me walk you through the capstone timeline..."

# Part 1: Capstone Lifecycle Overview
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The Capstone Timeline: Finding Phase

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| ~~Mid-October~~ | ~~Start looking for clients~~ |
| ~~Mid-November~~ | ~~Report potential projects~~ |
| **Dec – Feb** | Matchmaking ← **you are here** |
| **March 16** | Assigned to project |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This timeline orients students to where they are in the capstone process. The crossed-out dates show what should have happened already. Many students haven't started looking — this is a wake-up call.

**Key point:** You are here. If you haven't started looking for projects, you're behind.

**Say something like:**
"Let me show you the capstone timeline. Notice the crossed-out dates — mid-October, mid-November. Those are past. If you started looking for clients in October, you're in good shape. If you haven't started yet... you need to start today.

Right now we're in the matchmaking phase. December through February. This is when projects get assigned. March 16 is your deadline for being matched to a project.

The point of this slide: don't wait. The best projects get claimed early. If you wait until March, you'll get whatever's left."

**Transition:** "Here's what happens after you're matched..."
-->

---

## The Capstone Timeline: Execution Phase

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **March 30** | Submit PID |
| **April 10** | Project officially begins |
| **May 11** | Interim progress report |
| **June 8** | Final deliverables due |
| **June 10-12** | Final Exam |

**Key insight:** The hardest part isn't execution. It's finding and scoping.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This timeline shows the execution phase after project assignment. The key insight at the bottom is the real message: students worry about the wrong thing.

**Key point:** Finding and scoping is harder than execution. That's why this course exists.

**Say something like:**
"Once you're matched, here's what happens.

March 30: You submit your PID — Project Initiation Document. This is basically your Brief, formalized for the program.

April 10: Project officially begins. You have access, you have a sponsor, you start working.

May 11: Interim progress report. This is a checkpoint — are you on track?

June 8: Final deliverables due. Presentation, technical discussion, public summary.

June 10-12: Final exam period.

But here's the key insight — read the bottom of the slide. The hardest part isn't execution. It's finding and scoping. Most capstones that fail, fail before April. They fail because the student picked a bad project, or didn't scope it well, or didn't have an engaged sponsor. That's why we're spending this course on scoping, not on execution."

**Transition:** "Let me show you what you'll actually deliver..."
-->

---

## The Three Deliverables

**1. Project Presentation** (10-20 slides)
Problem, solution, and recommendations for your sponsor.

**2. Technical Discussion** (20-25 pages)
Complete consulting-style report with methodology details.

**3. Public Summary** (3 pages)
General audience essay for the ETD database.

All three require a **well-scoped project**. The Brief is your scoping tool.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students need to understand what they're actually producing. Three different documents for three different audiences.

**Key point:** All three deliverables depend on good scoping. A poorly scoped project makes all three documents harder to write.

**Say something like:**
"You'll produce three deliverables. Let me explain what each one is.

First, the Project Presentation. 10-20 slides. This is for your sponsor. It answers: what was the problem, what did you find, what do you recommend? This is what your sponsor will use to make decisions or share with their team.

Second, the Technical Discussion. 20-25 pages. This is a full consulting-style report. Methodology details, data descriptions, limitations, detailed findings. This is for someone who wants to understand exactly how you did the work.

Third, the Public Summary. 3 pages. This goes in the ETD database — the Electronic Theses and Dissertations archive. It's for a general audience. No jargon, no technical details. Just: what was the question, what did you find, why does it matter?

Here's the connection to this course: all three require a well-scoped project. If your project is vague, your presentation will be vague. If your methodology is unclear, your technical discussion will ramble. The Brief is your scoping tool — it makes all three documents easier to write."

**Transition:** "Let me show you how the Brief maps to these deliverables..."
-->

---

## How the Brief Scaffolds Your Capstone

Each Brief section maps to a capstone question:

- **Problem & Decision** → What question are you answering?
- **Metrics** → How will you measure success?
- **Stakeholders** → Who is your sponsor?
- **Methodology** → What analyses will you run?
- **Scope** → What's in and out?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This slide makes the connection between the Brief framework and capstone execution explicit. Each Brief section directly answers a question students will face.

**Key point:** The Brief isn't academic busywork — it directly maps to capstone questions.

**Say something like:**
"Let me connect what we've taught you to what you'll actually do.

Problem & Decision — this becomes 'what question are you answering?' in your capstone. If you can't answer this clearly, your project has no focus.

Metrics — this becomes 'how will you measure success?' If you don't define success precisely, how will you know when you're done?

Stakeholders — this is 'who is your sponsor?' And more importantly, who else cares? Who might block you?

Methodology — this answers 'what analyses will you run?' The 9 foundational analyses give you options. You pick 2-3 that fit your problem.

Scope — this is 'what's in and out?' Every sponsor wants more than you can deliver. Scope defines the boundaries.

The Brief isn't separate from your capstone. It IS the foundation of your capstone."

**Transition:** "You won't write the Brief all at once..."
-->

---

## Building Your Brief Over Time

**You'll practice Brief concepts through weekly write-ups (Jan 23 – Feb 27).**

First you'll practice concepts while searching for projects, then build Brief sections once assigned.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students often feel overwhelmed by the Brief framework. This slide reassures them: you don't do it all at once. The weekly write-ups build the skill incrementally.

**Key point:** The weekly write-ups are practice. By the time you write the real Brief, you'll have done each section before.

**Say something like:**
"You won't write the Brief all at once. That would be overwhelming.

Instead, you'll practice Brief concepts through the weekly write-ups. February 10 through March 17 — six weeks.

The first few write-ups happen while you're still searching for projects. You'll practice concepts like counter-metrics and stakeholder mapping on hypothetical scenarios. That way, when you find your real project, you already know how to think.

Once you're assigned to a project in March, the later write-ups help you build actual Brief sections. By the time you submit your PID in March, you've already practiced every section.

This is intentional. We scaffold the skill so you're not learning everything at once."

**Transition:** "Now let me tell you what makes a good project in the first place..."
-->

---

## What Makes a Good Capstone Project?

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Real business question** | Shows you can work on actual problems |
| **Access to data** | You can't analyze what you can't see |
| **Engaged sponsor** | Someone who cares about the answer |
| **Feasible scope** | Completable in the time available |
| **Demonstrable impact** | You can show what you did mattered |

**Warning signs:** Vague questions, unavailable data, absent sponsors.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This slide establishes the criteria for project selection. Students often accept the first project that comes along. These five criteria help them evaluate whether a project will be successful.

**Key point:** Not all projects are created equal. Learn to say no to bad projects.

**Say something like:**
"Let me tell you what makes a good capstone project.

Real business question: Not 'explore the data' but 'should we invest in X?' Real questions have answers that lead to decisions.

Access to data: Sounds obvious, but I've seen capstones fail because the promised data never materialized. Before you commit, see the data.

Engaged sponsor: Someone who will give you feedback, answer questions, and validate that your findings make sense. A sponsor who's 'too busy' is a red flag.

Feasible scope: You have limited time. A project that could take 6 months isn't a capstone; it's a full-time job. Scope it down.

Demonstrable impact: Can you show what you did mattered? If the analysis sits on a shelf, it's hard to talk about in interviews.

Warning signs: vague questions, unavailable data, absent sponsors. These are predictors of failed capstones."

**Transition:** "Let me say more about the sponsor relationship..."
-->

---

## Capstone Scope: Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Too broad** | "Optimize all marketing" → Never finishes |
| **Too narrow** | "Fix this one bug" → Not substantial enough |
| **No data access** | Promised data never materializes |
| **No decision-maker** | Analysis complete, nobody acts on it |
| **Dependent on others** | Blocked waiting for engineering/legal/etc. |

**The Brief forces you to address these before starting.**

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** These are the five most common reasons capstones fail. Each one is preventable with good upfront scoping.

**Key point:** Every failed capstone traces back to one of these five mistakes.

**Say something like:**
"Let me show you the five ways capstones fail.

Too broad: 'Optimize all marketing.' That's not a capstone — that's a career. You'll never finish because there's no finish line.

Too narrow: 'Fix this one bug.' That's not substantial enough for a capstone. You need something that demonstrates analytical thinking, not just execution.

No data access: 'We'll get you the data soon.' Famous last words. If you don't have data access before you commit, you might never get it.

No decision-maker: You complete amazing analysis, and... nothing happens. Nobody was going to act on it anyway. Make sure someone will actually use your work.

Dependent on others: 'We just need engineering to build this first.' If your project is blocked until someone else finishes their work, you've lost control of your timeline.

The Brief forces you to address all of these before you start. That's why we fill it out first."

**Transition:** "The most important factor in avoiding these mistakes is your sponsor..."
-->

---

## The Sponsor Relationship

Your sponsor is your primary stakeholder. They:
- Define the business problem
- Provide access to data
- Give feedback on approach
- Validate findings make sense

**Ideal sponsor:** Someone with a real question AND time to engage.

**Warning:** A sponsor who's "too busy" = no feedback = bad capstone.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** The sponsor relationship is often the difference between a successful and failed capstone. Students underestimate how important sponsor engagement is.

**Key point:** An engaged sponsor is more important than an interesting problem.

**Say something like:**
"Your sponsor is your primary stakeholder. Let me tell you what they do for you.

They define the business problem. Without them, you're guessing what matters.

They provide access to data. Without them, you can't get the data you need.

They give feedback on approach. Without them, you might spend weeks going in the wrong direction.

They validate that findings make sense. Without them, you don't know if your analysis reflects reality.

Here's what makes an ideal sponsor: someone with a real question AND time to engage. Both parts matter. A sponsor with a great question but no time? You'll get no feedback. A sponsor with lots of time but no real question? Your work won't matter.

The warning at the bottom: a sponsor who's 'too busy' means no feedback means bad capstone. If someone tells you they're excited about the project but can only meet once a month... that's a red flag. You need someone who will respond to emails, review your work, and tell you when you're off track."

**If asked:** "What if my sponsor becomes too busy during the project?"
A: Escalate early. Talk to your faculty advisor. Don't wait until June to mention you haven't gotten feedback since April.

**Transition:** "Now let's talk about finding these projects..."

# Part 2: Finding & Securing Projects
### *(25 minutes)*

## The October Principle

> **You should have started looking for capstone projects in October.**

If you haven't started yet, **start today.**

Why early matters:
- Good projects get claimed
- Building relationships takes time
- Data access takes time
- Scope negotiation takes time

March 16 is your assignment deadline. That's 9 weeks away.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Many students haven't started looking for projects yet. This slide is intentionally blunt. The urgency is real.

**Key point:** If you haven't started, start today. Not tomorrow. Today.

**Say something like:**
"The October Principle. You should have started looking for capstone projects in October.

[Pause. Let that land.]

If you started in October, great. You're ahead. If you haven't started yet... start today. Not next week. Today.

Here's why early matters:

Good projects get claimed. The best sponsors — engaged, interesting problems, good data — they get snapped up by students who started early. If you wait, you get leftovers.

Building relationships takes time. You can't email someone on March 15 and expect a project by March 16. Relationships need time to develop.

Data access takes time. Even when a sponsor says yes, getting actual data access often takes weeks. Legal reviews, IT permissions, anonymization — all of that takes time.

Scope negotiation takes time. Your sponsor will want more than you can deliver. Negotiating a reasonable scope takes multiple conversations.

March 16 is your deadline. That's 9 weeks away. 9 weeks is not a lot of time for all of these steps."

**Transition:** "So where do you actually find projects?..."
-->

---

## Where to Find Projects

- **Your employer** — Know the data (but may be narrow)
- **CEU network** — Curated, committed sponsors (competitive)
- **Personal network** — Relationship exists (quality varies)
- **Cold outreach** — Unlimited options (low response)
- **Nonprofits/NGOs** — Meaningful work (less data sophistication)

**Best approach:** Multiple channels simultaneously.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students often don't know where to start looking. This slide gives them five concrete channels, each with tradeoffs.

**Key point:** Don't rely on one channel. Pursue multiple simultaneously.

**Say something like:**
"Five places to find projects.

Your employer. Advantage: you already know the data, you have relationships, you understand the business. Disadvantage: might be narrow, might have confidentiality issues, might be too close to your day job.

CEU network. The program has connections with sponsors. Advantage: curated projects, committed sponsors. Disadvantage: competitive — everyone's looking at the same list.

Personal network. Friends, family, former colleagues. Advantage: relationship already exists, they want to help you. Disadvantage: quality varies — Uncle Bob's business idea might not be a good capstone.

Cold outreach. LinkedIn messages, emails to companies you admire. Advantage: unlimited options, you can target exactly what interests you. Disadvantage: low response rate. Most cold emails get ignored.

Nonprofits and NGOs. Advantage: meaningful work, often grateful for help. Disadvantage: data may be less sophisticated, less technical infrastructure.

Best approach: pursue multiple channels simultaneously. Don't wait to hear back from one before starting another."

**Transition:** "Let me give you specific tactics for activating your network..."
-->

---

## Network Activation

Most projects come through relationships. Activate your network:

1. **LinkedIn post** — "Looking for analytics capstone project for [school/program]"
2. **Email to contacts** — Personal ask to former colleagues, managers
3. **Alumni network** — CEU alumni who've done capstones
4. **Professional groups** — Meetups, Slack communities

**The ask:** "Do you know anyone with a data question they'd like help with?"

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Most students underutilize their network. This slide gives specific, actionable tactics.

**Key point:** The magic question is "Do you know anyone..." — it expands your reach beyond direct contacts.

**Say something like:**
"Most projects come through relationships. Here's how to activate your network.

LinkedIn post. Simple: 'Looking for an analytics capstone project for my Master's program. Specifically interested in [your areas]. Know anyone with a data question they'd like help with?' Post it publicly. You'll be surprised who responds.

Email to contacts. Go through your contacts — former colleagues, former managers, people you've worked with. Personal ask: 'I'm looking for a capstone project. Do you know anyone who might have a data question?'

Alumni network. CEU alumni who've done capstones understand what you need. Reach out. Ask who they worked with. Ask for introductions.

Professional groups. Meetups, Slack communities, industry groups. Post in relevant channels.

Notice the phrasing of the ask: 'Do you know anyone with a data question they'd like help with?' Not 'Do you have a project for me?' The 'do you know anyone' framing expands your reach. Even if they don't have a project, they might know someone who does."

**Transition:** "Once you find a potential project, how do you evaluate it?..."
-->

---

## Evaluating a Potential Project

Before committing, ask:

| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|---------------|
| What's the business question? | They can't articulate it |
| What data is available? | "We'll figure it out" |
| Who will I work with? | No named sponsor |
| What decisions will this inform? | "Just curious" |
| What's the timeline for access? | More than 2 weeks |

**It's okay to say no.** A bad project is worse than waiting.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students often feel pressure to accept the first project that comes along. This slide teaches them to evaluate critically.

**Key point:** It's okay to say no. A bad project is worse than waiting.

**Say something like:**
"Before you commit to a project, ask these five questions.

What's the business question? If they can't articulate it — if it's 'just explore the data' or 'tell us something interesting' — that's a red flag. No clear question means no clear success.

What data is available? If the answer is 'we'll figure it out' — red flag. You need to know what data exists before you commit.

Who will I work with? If there's no named sponsor — red flag. 'The team' isn't a sponsor. You need a person with a name who will give you feedback.

What decisions will this inform? If the answer is 'we're just curious' — red flag. Analysis that doesn't lead to decisions is analysis that doesn't matter.

What's the timeline for access? If getting data will take more than 2 weeks — that's a warning sign. Delays at the beginning cascade throughout the project.

And here's the key message at the bottom: It's okay to say no. A bad project is worse than waiting. If you take a project with red flags, you'll spend 4 months struggling. Better to wait for a good one."

**Transition:** "Let me show you specific red flag phrases to listen for..."
-->

---

## Red Flags in Project Proposals

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| "We have tons of data, just explore" | No clear question |
| "We'll get you access soon" | Data may never come |
| "The CEO is very interested" | But never available |
| "This is a simple project" | Scope will creep |
| "We've tried this before" | Previous failures; why? |
| "It needs to be done by [soon]" | Not a capstone, it's free labor |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** These are actual phrases students have heard from potential sponsors. Each one sounds benign but predicts problems. Teaching students to recognize these early saves them from bad projects.

**Key point:** Learn the language of red flags. Trust your instincts when something feels off.

**Say something like:**
"Let me teach you the language of red flags. These are actual things sponsors have said to students.

'We have tons of data, just explore.' This means there's no clear question. Exploration without a question is a recipe for wasted time.

'We'll get you access soon.' This often means the data never comes. Before you commit, SEE the data.

'The CEO is very interested.' But the CEO is never available. Interest without availability isn't helpful.

'This is a simple project.' Simple projects creep. If they say it's simple, ask why they haven't done it themselves.

'We've tried this before.' Ask why it failed. You might be walking into the same problem.

'It needs to be done by [soon].' If it's urgent, it's not a capstone — it's free labor. Capstones have academic timelines.

When you hear these phrases, dig deeper or walk away."

**Transition:** "How do you negotiate scope when sponsors want too much?..."
-->

---

## Negotiating Scope with Sponsors

Sponsors often want **more** than is feasible.

**Your job:** Negotiate a scope that's:
- Valuable to them
- Feasible for you
- Demonstrable as a capstone

**How:**
- "What's the most important question?"
- "If we could only answer one thing, what would it be?"
- "What would you do with the answer?"

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Scope negotiation is a skill students rarely have. Sponsors naturally want as much as possible. Students need to learn to push back constructively.

**Key point:** Your job is to find the intersection: valuable to them, feasible for you, demonstrable as a capstone.

**Say something like:**
"Sponsors will always want more than you can deliver. That's not malicious — they have big problems and they want them solved. Your job is to negotiate.

A good scope sits at the intersection of three things:

Valuable to them. It has to matter. If you scope it so small that no one cares about the answer, what's the point?

Feasible for you. You have limited time, limited access, limited expertise in their domain. The scope has to be something you can actually complete.

Demonstrable as a capstone. It has to be substantial enough to show analytical thinking. 'Count the rows in a table' isn't a capstone.

Three questions that help you find this intersection:

'What's the most important question?' Forces them to prioritize.

'If we could only answer one thing, what would it be?' Forces them to pick.

'What would you do with the answer?' Reveals whether there's actually a decision at stake.

Use these questions. They're magic."

**Transition:** "Let me show you what this conversation sounds like..."
-->

---

## The Scope Conversation

**Sponsor says:** "We want to optimize our entire customer journey."

**You say:** "That's a great long-term goal. For the capstone, what if we focused on [specific part]? We could do a funnel analysis on the checkout flow and identify the biggest drop-off points. Would that be valuable?"

**Key moves:**
- Acknowledge their big goal
- Propose a specific slice
- Check if it's valuable

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is a concrete example of scope negotiation. Students can use this exact pattern.

**Key point:** Acknowledge, propose, check. Three moves that make scope negotiation work.

**Say something like:**
"Here's what the conversation actually sounds like.

Sponsor says: 'We want to optimize our entire customer journey.' That's huge. That's not a capstone — that's a 5-year company initiative.

You say: 'That's a great long-term goal.' First move: acknowledge. Don't say 'that's too big' — that feels like rejection. Say 'that's a great goal.' Validate their ambition.

Then: 'For the capstone, what if we focused on the checkout flow?' Second move: propose a specific slice. You're not asking them to scope it — you're offering a proposal.

Then: 'Would that be valuable?' Third move: check. Make sure your proposed slice actually matters to them. If they say 'no, checkout isn't the problem,' you've learned something important.

Three moves: Acknowledge their big goal. Propose a specific slice. Check if it's valuable.

This pattern works every time. Practice it."

**If asked:** "What if they insist on the big scope?"
A: Explain the constraints honestly. 'I have 8 weeks and limited access. If I try to do everything, I'll do nothing well. If I focus on checkout, I can give you something actionable.' Frame it as quality vs. scope.

**Transition:** "Let's practice evaluating a project..."
-->

---

## Exercise: Evaluate a Project

> **Scenario:** A startup founder says: "We have 6 months of user data. I want to know why users churn and how to fix it. I'm super busy but I can meet once a month. Data is in a CSV somewhere."

> **Think (2 min):** Would you take this project? What questions would you ask?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This exercise applies the red flags framework to a realistic scenario. Every phrase in the founder's pitch contains a warning sign. Students should practice recognizing these before they encounter them in real life.

**Key point:** Learn to hear the warning signs hidden in optimistic language.

**Say something like:**
"Here's a real scenario. A startup founder approaches you. Listen to what they say:

'We have 6 months of user data.' — Okay, that's something.

'I want to know why users churn and how to fix it.' — Broad. Very broad. 'Why users churn' could mean a hundred different analyses. And 'how to fix it' implies they want you to solve the problem, not just diagnose it.

'I'm super busy but I can meet once a month.' — Red flag. Once a month means no feedback loop. You'll do work, wait weeks for input, and maybe find out you went in the wrong direction.

'Data is in a CSV somewhere.' — Major red flag. 'Somewhere' means they don't know where it is, which means they haven't looked at it, which means they don't know if it's usable.

Take 2 minutes. Would you take this project? What questions would you ask before deciding?"

**Facilitation:** Give them 2 minutes to think. Then cold-call 2-3 students.

**Strong answers to look for:**
- "I'd want to see the data before committing" — Correct. Never commit blind.
- "I'd ask who else I can contact for feedback" — Good. If the founder is busy, who's my day-to-day contact?
- "I'd ask what specific decision this informs" — Excellent. 'Why users churn' isn't actionable. 'Should we change onboarding or pricing?' is.
- "I'd scope it down to one question" — Great. Turn 'why users churn' into 'what's the primary driver of D30 churn?'

**Weak answers to push back on:**
- "I'd take it because startups are exciting" — Excitement doesn't make up for bad project structure.
- "I'd figure it out as I go" — That's how capstones fail.

**Transition:** "Now let me tell you about your assignment..."

# Part 3: Your Assignment — Scenario → Brief
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The Assignment

**Due:** Thursday, January 16, 2026, 23:59 CET

**What you'll receive:** A unique 2-page business scenario describing:
- A company and its situation
- A business problem
- Key stakeholders
- Available data
- Constraints

**What you'll submit:** A complete Analytics Project Brief for that scenario.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the first major assignment (30% of grade). Each student receives a unique scenario to prevent copying and force independent thinking. The deadline is Thursday evening, giving students 4 days to complete it.

**Key point:** Unique scenarios mean you can't collaborate on answers. You can discuss approaches but not share your Brief.

**Say something like:**
"Let me tell you about your assignment.

Due Thursday, January 16 at 23:59 CET. That's four days from now.

You'll each receive a unique 2-page business scenario. Different company, different problem, different constraints. This is intentional — it prevents copying and forces you to think independently.

The scenario will give you everything you need: the company situation, the business problem, key stakeholders, available data, and constraints. Your job is to write a complete Analytics Project Brief for that scenario.

You'll receive your scenario via email after class today. If you don't receive it by tonight, email me."

**If asked:** "Can we work together?"
A: You can discuss the Brief framework and general approaches. You cannot share your scenario or your Brief sections. Each scenario is unique to you.

**Transition:** "Why unique scenarios?..."
-->

---

## Why Unique Scenarios?

Each student receives a **different scenario**.

This is intentional:
- Prevents copying
- Forces independent thinking
- Creates variety for class discussion
- Mirrors real-world (you don't get the same problem as a colleague)

Your scenario will be distributed via email after class today.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students often want to collaborate, especially on challenging assignments. This slide explains why unique scenarios are essential. The key is framing it positively (forces independent thinking, mirrors reality) rather than punitively (prevents cheating).

**Key point:** Unique scenarios aren't about distrust — they're about developing individual judgment that you'll need in your career.

**Say something like:**
"Each of you will receive a different scenario. This is intentional, and let me explain why.

First, it prevents copying. That's the obvious one. But that's not the main reason.

The main reason is this: it forces independent thinking. In your career, you won't have a classmate with the same problem. You'll have to scope projects yourself, make judgment calls yourself, identify blockers yourself. This assignment simulates that.

It also creates variety for class discussion. When we review these in the exam or in office hours, we can discuss different approaches to different problems. That's more valuable than everyone having the same answer.

And it mirrors reality. Your colleague doesn't get the same project as you. You can discuss frameworks and approaches — that's valuable — but you can't copy their scoping document. Same here."

**If asked:** "Can we work together?"
A: You can discuss the Brief framework. You can ask each other 'how do you think about counter-metrics?' You cannot share your specific scenario or your specific Brief sections. Think of it like studying together for an exam — you can quiz each other on concepts, but you can't share your answers during the test.

**If asked:** "What if we accidentally got the same scenario?"
A: You won't. Each scenario is generated uniquely. If you think you received the same one as someone else, email me immediately — it would be a system error.

**Transition:** "Let me show you what excellent looks like..."
-->

## What Makes an Excellent Submission?

**Metrics** — Precise SQL-level definition, not "conversion rate"

**Counter-metrics** — Specific, with guardrail/tradeoff labeled

**Stakeholders** — Named blockers with motivation, not "leadership"

**Methodology** — Justified analysis selection, not "we'll look at the data"

**Pre-mortem** — Specific failure scenario, not generic

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This slide previews what distinguishes excellent from mediocre submissions. It's a quick overview before showing examples.

**Key point:** Precision is the theme. Vague answers lose points. Specific answers earn them.

**Say something like:**
"Let me show you what separates excellent submissions from mediocre ones. One word: precision.

Metrics: Precise SQL-level definition. Not 'conversion rate' — that's meaningless. What events? What timeframe? What exclusions? Could someone write the SQL?

Counter-metrics: Specific, labeled as guardrail or tradeoff. Not just 'revenue' — what about revenue? What threshold? Why might it break?

Stakeholders: Named blockers with motivations. Not 'leadership' — that's not a stakeholder. Sarah, the Head of Growth, who recently got promoted based on the current approach — that's a stakeholder.

Methodology: Justified analysis selection. Not 'we'll look at the data' — why funnel analysis? Why this approach and not that one?

Pre-mortem: Specific failure scenario. Not 'the data was bad' — that's generic. 'We confused correlation with causation and recommended mandating a behavior that killed signups' — that's specific.

Let me show you examples of each..."

**Transition:** Move to Metric Definition Example.
-->

---

## Metric Definition Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Primary metric: User engagement

✅ **Excellent:**
> Primary metric: D7 Active Users — Users with ≥1 `session_start` event on calendar day 7 after `signup_complete` event on day 0, excluding users flagged as `bot=true`, trailing 7-day rolling average

**The test:** Could someone write the SQL from your definition?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** The metric example is the most common failure mode. Students write vague metrics like "engagement" or "conversion" without defining them.

**Key point:** The SQL test is the key. If someone can't write the query from your definition, it's not precise enough.

**Say something like:**
"Here's a metric example a strong submission.

Weak: 'Primary metric: User engagement.' What does that mean? Clicks? Sessions? Time spent? This is meaningless.

Excellent: 'D7 Active Users — Users with at least one session_start event on calendar day 7 after signup_complete on day 0, excluding users flagged as bot=true, trailing 7-day rolling average.'

Notice what's in here: The specific event. The specific day. The exclusions. The calculation method. Someone could write the SQL query from this definition.

That's the test: Could someone write the SQL from your definition? If yes, it's precise. If no, it's vague."

**Transition:** "Counter-metrics need the same precision..."
-->

---

## Counter-Metric Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Counter-metric: Revenue

✅ **Excellent:**
> Counter-metric: Revenue per User (Guardrail)
> - Definition: `total_revenue` / `active_users`, monthly
> - Why it could break: Aggressive conversion tactics may bring in low-value users
> - How we'll measure: Monitor RPU trend during and after intervention
> - Threshold: Must not decline >5% from baseline

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Counter-metrics are where most students lose points. They either forget them entirely or write vague ones.

**Key point:** A counter-metric needs four things: definition, why it might break, how you'll measure, and threshold.

**Say something like:**
"Counter-metrics. This is where a lot of points get lost.

Weak: 'Counter-metric: Revenue.' That's not a counter-metric — it's just a word. What about revenue? How is it a counter-metric?

Excellent: Look at the structure here.

First, definition: Revenue per User, total revenue divided by active users, monthly. Precise.

Second, why it could break: Aggressive conversion tactics may bring in low-value users. This is the 'what breaks' thinking.

Third, how we'll measure: Monitor RPU trend during and after intervention. You have a plan.

Fourth, threshold: Must not decline more than 5% from baseline. This is the guardrail — the line you won't cross.

Four components: definition, why it breaks, measurement plan, threshold. If you're missing any of these, your counter-metric isn't complete."

**Transition:** "Stakeholders need the same specificity..."
-->

---

## Stakeholder Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Stakeholders: Product team, executives

✅ **Excellent:**
> **Blocker:** Head of Growth
> - Motivation: Their team built the current onboarding flow; findings may imply their work failed
> - Current status: Recently promoted based on "successful" launch metrics
> - Mitigation: Private pre-brief, frame as "learning opportunity," acknowledge what worked before discussing what didn't

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Stakeholder sections often list job titles instead of people with motivations. The difference is critical.

**Key point:** A stakeholder is a person with a name, a motivation, and a reason to care. 'Leadership' is not a stakeholder.

**Say something like:**
"Stakeholder example.

Weak: 'Stakeholders: Product team, executives.' These are categories, not stakeholders. What do they want? Why do they care? Will they help or hinder?

Excellent: Look at this blocker description.

'Head of Growth' — a specific person, not a category.

Motivation: 'Their team built the current onboarding flow; findings may imply their work failed.' This is why they might resist.

Current status: 'Recently promoted based on successful launch metrics.' This is political context. Their promotion was tied to the thing you're about to critique.

Mitigation: 'Private pre-brief, frame as learning opportunity, acknowledge what worked.' This is your strategy for handling them.

This is a real stakeholder analysis. You understand who they are, why they might block you, and how to handle it. 'Executives' tells me nothing."

**Transition:** "Finally, the pre-mortem..."
-->

---

## Pre-Mortem Example

❌ **Weak:** "The project failed because we didn't have good data."

✅ **Excellent:** "Tutorial completers retain 2x better → mandated tutorial → signup dropped 40%. We confused correlation with causation. Should have A/B tested shorter tutorial."

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Pre-mortems are where students either excel or fail completely. Generic pre-mortems are worthless. Specific ones show real thinking.

**Key point:** A good pre-mortem tells a specific story of how THIS project could fail.

**Say something like:**
"Pre-mortem example. This is where I see the biggest gap between weak and excellent.

Weak: 'The project failed because we didn't have good data.' This is generic. It could apply to any project. It shows no thinking about YOUR specific situation.

Excellent: Read this one. 'Tutorial completers retain 2x better. We mandated the tutorial. Signup dropped 40%. We confused correlation with causation. Should have A/B tested a shorter tutorial.'

This is a story. It's specific to this project. The failure mode is correlation vs. causation — a trap we've discussed. The consequence is concrete — signup dropped 40%. The fix is specific — should have A/B tested.

A good pre-mortem is a story you can tell about how THIS project might fail. Not 'data might be bad.' How might YOUR analysis lead to a bad decision? What trap might YOU fall into? What would YOU do differently if you could start over?"

**Transition:** "Now let me show you how the assignment is graded..."
-->

---

## Grading Rubric Preview

| Section | Pts | Section | Pts |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Problem & Decision | 10 | Scope & Success | 10 |
| Metrics | 15 | Risks & Pre-Mortem | 15 |
| Stakeholders | 15 | Overall coherence | 20 |
| Methodology | 15 | | |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** The rubric shows where points are allocated. Metrics, Stakeholders, and Pre-Mortem are weighted heavily because these are where students typically struggle most. Overall Coherence (20 pts) is the largest single category — this is where most points are lost.

**Key point:** Coherence matters most. Sections must connect, not stand alone.

**Say something like:**
"Here's how the assignment is graded. Notice the distribution.

Problem & Decision: 10 points. This should be the easiest section.

Metrics: 15 points. SQL-level precision matters. 'Conversion rate' with no definition will lose points.

Stakeholders: 15 points. Named blockers with motivations, not 'leadership.'

Methodology: 15 points. Justified analysis selection, not 'we'll look at the data.'

Scope & Success: 10 points. Clear in/out scope, decision criteria.

Risks & Pre-Mortem: 15 points. Specific failure scenarios, not generic.

And the big one: Overall Coherence. 20 points. This is where most points are lost. Your sections need to connect. The methodology must answer the problem. The counter-metrics must anticipate the pre-mortem. If your sections feel like independent documents, you'll lose points here."

**Transition:** "Let me explain what coherence means..."
-->

---

## Overall Coherence (20 points)

This is where most points are lost. Two parts:

**Internal Consistency (10 pts):**
- Do your metrics align with your methodology?
- Does your pre-mortem connect to your risks and stakeholders?
- Do decision criteria match your problem statement?
- Does scope match the timeline and data you have?

**Professional Quality (10 pts):**
- Clear, concise writing
- Would you present this to a real sponsor?
- No contradictions between sections

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Overall Coherence is the largest single category (20 points) and where most students lose points. Sections that don't connect indicate shallow thinking.

**Key point:** Sections must connect to each other. A Brief isn't 10 independent answers — it's one integrated document.

**Say something like:**
"Overall Coherence. 20 points. This is the largest single category, and it's where most points are lost.

Two parts:

Internal Consistency — 10 points. Do your sections connect?

Does your metric align with your methodology? If you're measuring D7 retention, your methodology better include retention analysis.

Does your pre-mortem connect to your risks and stakeholders? If you identified the Head of Growth as a blocker, your pre-mortem might involve them resisting your findings.

Do your decision criteria match your problem statement? If the problem is 'should we shift budget,' the decision criteria should say what would make you shift it.

Does scope match your timeline and data? If you only have 6 weeks and limited data, your scope should reflect that.

Professional Quality — 10 points. Would you present this to a real sponsor? Is the writing clear? Are there contradictions between sections?

If your Brief reads like 10 separate documents pasted together, you'll lose points here. If it reads like one integrated analysis, you'll earn them."

**Transition:** "Let me give you a recommended process..."
-->

---

## Process Recommendation

1. **Read the scenario twice** — First for overview, second for details
2. **Identify the core decision** — What will this analysis inform?
3. **Draft the metric first** — Forces precision early
4. **Work through stakeholders** — Who might block? Why?
5. **Select methodology** — Which 2-3 analyses apply?
6. **Write the pre-mortem last** — After you understand the full picture

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This sequence matters. Students often jump straight to methodology ("I'll do a funnel analysis!") without understanding the decision context. Or they write the pre-mortem first and it's too generic. This order forces precision at each stage.

**Key point:** The order isn't arbitrary — each step informs the next. Shortcuts create incoherent Briefs.

**Say something like:**
"Let me explain why this order matters.

Read the scenario twice. First time for the overall situation — what's the company, what's the problem, what are the constraints. Second time for the details — the specific data available, the stakeholder dynamics, the timeline.

Identify the core decision first. Before you pick metrics or analyses, ask: what decision will this inform? 'Should we shift budget?' 'Should we change the onboarding flow?' If you can't state the decision, you're not ready to write the Brief.

Draft the metric first. This forces precision early. 'Conversion rate' is vague. 'Users who complete checkout within 7 days of first session' is precise. Getting this right early makes everything else easier.

Work through stakeholders next. Who cares about this decision? Who might block it? Why? This is where you identify the politics before you run the analysis.

Select methodology after you understand the context. Not before. If you jump to 'I'll do a cohort analysis' before understanding the decision, you might pick the wrong analysis.

Write the pre-mortem last. Why? Because it's a failure story about THIS project. If you don't understand your metrics, stakeholders, and methodology, your pre-mortem will be generic. 'The data was bad.' That's not useful. A good pre-mortem is specific to what could go wrong with YOUR approach."

**If asked:** "What if I want to do it in a different order?"
A: You can. But I've seen what happens when students skip steps or reorder them — the Brief sections don't connect, and that's where coherence points are lost. This order is a recommendation based on what works.

**Transition:** "Questions before we move on?..."
-->

---

## Questions About the Assignment?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Take 3-4 questions.
Common Qs:
- "How long should it be?" → Quality > length, but typically 3-5 pages
- "Can I use the template?" → Yes, it's designed for this
- "What if I don't know something?" → "Unknown/TBD" is honest; blank is not

## Weekly Write-Ups: What to Expect

You'll submit 6 weekly write-ups from Jan 23 – Feb 27.

These are **practice exercises** that prepare you for your capstone.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students may see weekly write-ups as busywork. Reframe them as practice that directly prepares for the capstone.

**Key point:** These aren't homework — they're practice reps that make the capstone easier.

**Say something like:**
"From January 23 to February 27, you'll submit 6 weekly write-ups.

These aren't busywork. They're practice exercises. Each one practices a skill you'll need for your capstone.

Think of them as reps. By the time you write your real Brief, you'll have practiced each component separately. You won't be learning and executing at the same time."

**Transition:** "Here's the schedule..."
-->

---

## Weekly Write-Up Schedule

| Week | Due Date | Topic |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Jan 23 | Capstone Search Kickoff |
| 2 | Jan 30 | Counter-Metrics in the Wild |
| 3 | Feb 6 | Analysis Methodology Selection |
| 4 | Feb 13 | Evaluating Project Opportunities |
| 5 | Feb 20 | Pre-Mortem on a Hypothetical |
| 6 | Feb 27 | Capstone Readiness Check |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** The schedule shows how the write-ups build toward capstone readiness. Early ones practice concepts; later ones apply to real projects.

**Key point:** The sequence is intentional — practice concepts first, then apply to real projects.

**Say something like:**
"Let me walk through the schedule.

Week 1, February 10: Capstone Search Kickoff. You'll document what you're doing to find projects. This forces you to start looking.

Week 2, February 17: Counter-Metrics in the Wild. Find a real example of metric optimization gone wrong. Apply the 'What Breaks' framework.

Week 3, February 24: Analysis Methodology Selection. Practice picking the right analyses for a scenario.

Week 4, March 3: Evaluating Project Opportunities. If you've found potential projects, evaluate them against the red flags checklist.

Week 5, March 10: Pre-Mortem on a Hypothetical. Write a pre-mortem for a scenario — practicing the skill.

Week 6, March 17: Capstone Readiness Check. By now you should be matched. This is a checkpoint: are you ready?

Notice the progression: early weeks practice concepts, later weeks apply to your actual search."

**Transition:** "Here's the format..."
-->

---

## Weekly Write-Up Format

**Short.** Each write-up is ~1 page.

**Pass/Fail.** Genuine engagement matters, not perfection.

**Sample prompts:**
> Week 2 (Jan 30): "Find an article about metric optimization gone wrong. Apply the 'What Breaks' framework."
> Week 4 (Feb 13): "Evaluate 1-2 potential capstone projects against the red flags checklist."

**By Week 6 (Feb 27):** You're ready for your capstone.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students worry about workload. Emphasize that write-ups are short and pass/fail — genuine effort is all that's needed.

**Key point:** Pass/fail means genuine engagement, not perfection. One page is enough.

**Say something like:**
"The format is designed to be low-stakes.

Short — one page. Don't write essays. Answer the prompt concisely.

Pass/fail — not graded on a curve. If you genuinely engage with the prompt, you pass. If you don't submit or submit something perfunctory, you don't.

Look at the sample prompts. Week 2: find an article about metric optimization gone wrong, apply the What Breaks framework. That's maybe 30 minutes of reading and 30 minutes of writing. Week 4: evaluate potential capstone projects against the red flags checklist. That's work you should be doing anyway.

By Week 6, you're ready for your capstone. That's the goal."

**Transition:** "Now let me tell you about the exam..."
-->

---

## The Exam: January 27

**Format:** 90 minutes, closed book, one A4 cheat sheet allowed

**Structure:**

| Part | Time | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| A | 30 min | Concepts — Definitions, Goodhart's Law, influence strategies |
| B | 15 min | Matching — Connect problems to appropriate analyses |
| C | 45 min | Applied — Complete Brief sections for a new scenario |

**Preparation:** Review the Brief framework, 9 analyses, counter-metrics, stakeholder mapping.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students need to know what to expect on the exam. This overview reduces anxiety.

**Key point:** The exam tests application, not memorization. The cheat sheet is allowed precisely because memorization isn't the point.

**Say something like:**
"The exam is January 27. 90 minutes, closed book, but you can bring one A4 cheat sheet — handwritten or typed, both sides.

Three parts:

Part A, 30 minutes: Concepts. Definitions, Goodhart's Law, influence strategies. This is 'do you understand the ideas.'

Part B, 15 minutes: Matching. Connect problems to appropriate analyses. 'Given this scenario, which of the 9 analyses applies?' This tests whether you can select the right tool.

Part C, 45 minutes: Applied. You'll get a new scenario and complete Brief sections. This is the core of the exam — can you apply the framework?

The cheat sheet is allowed because this isn't about memorization. I want you to think, not to recall. Put the 9 analyses on your cheat sheet. Put the counter-metrics framework. Focus your study on application, not memorization."

**Transition:** "If you need help between now and then..."

## Office Hours & Support

**Office hours:** By appointment (email to schedule)

**Email:** rubiae@ceu.edu (use clear subject line)

**Urgent matters:** earino@gmail.com

**Zoom interventions:** Available for strategic discussions about your capstone

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students should know how to reach you. This is straightforward logistics.

**Key point:** Office hours are available. Use them.

**Say something like:**
"If you need help, here's how to reach me.

Office hours by appointment. Email me to schedule — I'm flexible.

Regular email: rubiae@ceu.edu. Use a clear subject line so I can prioritize.

Urgent matters: earino@gmail.com. If something is time-sensitive and you need a faster response.

Zoom is available for strategic discussions about your capstone. If you're stuck on project selection or scope negotiation, we can talk through it.

The key message: don't struggle alone. If you're stuck, reach out."

**Transition:** "Let me summarize what we've covered..."
-->

---

## What You've Learned

| Day 1 | Day 2 |
|-------|-------|
| The Analytics Project Brief | Application & practice |
| Counter-metrics & adversarial thinking | Influence strategies |
| 9 foundational analyses | Stakeholder communication |
| Stakeholder mapping | Capstone preparation |

**One framework, applied repeatedly.**

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This summary slide recaps the two days. It helps students see the coherence of the course.

**Key point:** One framework, applied repeatedly. That's the course in four words.

**Say something like:**
"Let me summarize what we've covered.

Day 1: The Analytics Project Brief — the framework. Counter-metrics and adversarial thinking — what breaks. The 9 foundational analyses — your toolkit. Stakeholder mapping — who matters.

Day 2: Application and practice — using the framework on scenarios. Influence strategies — how to communicate your findings. Stakeholder communication — making it stick. Capstone preparation — applying it to your project.

Notice the theme: one framework, applied repeatedly. The Brief is the through-line. Everything else builds on it or supports it.

You now have a professional tool for scoping analytics projects. Use it."

**Transition:** "Let me leave you with five core messages..."
-->

---

## The Core Messages

1. **"Fill out the Brief before you analyze."** — Not after. Not during. Before.

2. **"What breaks if you succeed?"** — Always identify counter-metrics.

3. **"Never surprise a stakeholder."** — Pre-brief uncomfortable findings.

4. **"Correlation ≠ causation."** — A/B test before mandating changes.

5. **"Your job is never to optimize a metric."** — Improve the experience it measures.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** These five messages are the course distilled to its essence. If students remember nothing else, these five principles will serve them throughout their careers.

**Key point:** Five principles that will guide your work for years.

**Say something like:**
"If you remember nothing else from this course, remember these five things.

One: Fill out the Brief before you analyze. Not after. Not during. Before. 30 minutes of scoping saves 30 hours of wrong analysis.

Two: What breaks if you succeed? Always identify counter-metrics. Optimization without guardrails is dangerous.

Three: Never surprise a stakeholder. Pre-brief uncomfortable findings. The meeting should be confirmation, not revelation.

Four: Correlation is not causation. Before you recommend forcing a behavior on users, A/B test it. Tutorial completers retain better, but mandating tutorials might not improve retention.

Five: Your job is never to optimize a metric. Your job is to improve the experience that the metric measures. The metric is a proxy. Don't optimize the proxy at the expense of reality.

These five principles will guide your work for years. Write them down."

**Transition:** "And here's why each tool we taught you matters..."
-->

---

## What Each Piece Prevents

| Tool | Prevents |
|------|----------|
| **The Brief** | Analysis nobody acts on |
| **Counter-metrics** | Decisions that backfire |
| **Stakeholder mapping** | Decisions that get blocked |
| **Pre-mortem** | Failures you could have seen coming |

Every tool exists to make sure your work **drives a decision**.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This slide connects each tool to the problem it solves. It reinforces why we taught what we taught.

**Key point:** Every tool exists to prevent a specific failure mode. They're not academic — they're practical.

**Say something like:**
"Let me connect each tool to the problem it prevents.

The Brief prevents analysis nobody acts on. Without upfront alignment, you might build something brilliant that sits on a shelf because it wasn't what stakeholders needed.

Counter-metrics prevent decisions that backfire. Without adversarial thinking, you might optimize a metric at the expense of something important — like Wells Fargo optimizing account openings.

Stakeholder mapping prevents decisions that get blocked. Without understanding who has power and interest, you might run into political resistance you never saw coming.

The pre-mortem prevents failures you could have seen coming. Without imagining what could go wrong, you might walk into traps that were obvious in hindsight.

Every tool exists for a reason. They all serve the same goal: making sure your work drives a decision."

**Transition:** "Let me close with some final thoughts..."
-->

---

## Final Thoughts

The technical skills will evolve. Python libraries change. New tools emerge.

But the **discipline of scoping projects well** is durable.

In 10 years:
- You may not remember SQL syntax
- You will remember to ask "what breaks if we succeed?"
- You will remember to identify blockers before presenting
- You will remember to scope before analyzing

**That's what this course is for.**

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the emotional close of the course. Students have absorbed a lot of content over two days. This slide is about durable value — the distinction between technical skills that depreciate and professional habits that compound. The goal is for students to feel that what they learned will matter throughout their careers, not just for the capstone.

**Key point:** Technical skills change. The discipline of scoping well is forever.

**Say something like:**
"I want to close with something that I hope you'll remember years from now.

The technical skills you've learned — and will continue to learn — will evolve. The Python library you master this year might be deprecated in five years. The SQL syntax you memorize will be replaced by something else. The hot analytical framework of today will be the legacy system of tomorrow.

That's fine. That's how technology works. You'll adapt.

But the discipline of scoping projects well? That's durable. In 10 years, you might not remember the syntax for a cohort retention query. But you WILL remember to ask 'what breaks if we succeed?' You WILL remember to identify blockers before you present uncomfortable findings. You WILL remember that 30 minutes of scoping saves 30 hours of wrong analysis.

That's what this course is for. Not to teach you tools that will change. To teach you habits that will compound.

The Brief framework is just a structure. The real skill is the discipline: don't start analyzing until you've done the hard work of alignment. That discipline will serve you whether you're a junior analyst or a VP. Whether you're in tech or healthcare or finance. Whether analytics looks like Python or something that doesn't exist yet.

[Pause]

I hope you carry that with you."

**If asked:** [unlikely at this moment]

**Transition:** "Any final questions?"
-->

---

## Questions?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Final Q&A before the course ends. This is the last chance for students to clarify anything. If there are no questions, use the reflection prompt.

**Key point:** End with reflection if no questions.

**Facilitation:**
Take final questions. If none after 15 seconds:

"What's one thing you'll do differently in your next analytics project?"

Cold call 2-3 students. Listen to their answers. Affirm good ones.

This creates closure and reinforces learning through verbalization.

**Common final questions:**
- "Where can we learn more?" → Point to the reading list, suggest books on analytics project management
- "Will this really help with the capstone?" → Yes, the Brief is the foundation of good scoping
- "Can I contact you if I'm stuck?" → Yes, office hours by appointment

**Transition:** "Thank you all for your engagement..."
-->

# Good luck with your capstones!

**Your job is to drive better decisions with data.**

Fill out the Brief before you analyze.
Ask "what breaks?" before you recommend.
Never surprise a stakeholder.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the final slide. It should stay on screen as students leave. The three principles are the course in three lines.

**Key point:** Leave the room with these principles visible.

**Say something like:**
"Your job is to drive better decisions with data. That's what analytics is for.

Three things to remember:
Fill out the Brief before you analyze.
Ask 'what breaks?' before you recommend.
Never surprise a stakeholder.

Thank you. Good luck with your capstones. I'll see your Briefs on Thursday."
