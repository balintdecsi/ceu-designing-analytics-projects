## Course at a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Format** | 2-day intensive (6 blocks × 100 min) |
| **Core Framework** | The Analytics Project Brief |
| **Analyses** | 9 foundational analyses across the customer journey |
| **Goal** | Prepare you for your capstone project |

**One artifact, applied repeatedly.**

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students are used to courses that cover many tools or techniques. This course is intentionally focused: one framework (the Brief), applied to different contexts. The 2-day intensive format means we move fast — there's no room for tangents. The capstone connection is the "why this matters."

**Key point:** One artifact, applied repeatedly. Simplicity is intentional.

**Say something like:**
"I want to set expectations. This is a different kind of course.

We're not going to cover 20 techniques superficially. We're going to learn one framework — the Analytics Project Brief — and apply it over and over. You'll see it in different contexts: funnel analysis, attribution, retention, and so on. But it's the same framework each time.

By the end of these two days, filling out a Brief should feel natural. That's the goal. And this directly prepares you for your capstone project, where you'll use this framework for real."

**Transition:** "Here's how the two days are structured..."
