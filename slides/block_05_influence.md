## Block 5: Stakeholders & Influence

**Eduardo Arino de la Rubia**
January 12, 2026

## Block 5 Overview

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| **Stakeholder Management** | **25 min** |
| Processing Fluency | 8 min |
| Message Theory Cheat-Sheet | 2 min |
| Four Influence Strategies | 30 min |
| Stakeholder-Strategy Integration | 12 min |
| Think-Pair-Share: Influence Planning | 15 min |

## Day 2 Theme: The People

> **Day 1 was about "The Work"** — scoping, metrics, analyses.
>
> **Day 2 is about "The People"** — stakeholders, influence, communication.

The best analysis fails if:
- The wrong people see it
- The right people don't buy in
- A blocker kills it politically

**Technical correctness is necessary but not sufficient.**

# Part 1: Stakeholder Management
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## Why Stakeholders Matter

Your job includes navigating organizational dynamics.

| Without Stakeholder Awareness | With Stakeholder Awareness |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Surprised by resistance | Anticipated and addressed |
| Analysis ignored | Analysis acted upon |
| "Why didn't anyone tell me?" | "I saw that coming" |

**Every analysis exists in a political context.** Ignoring it is a choice — usually a bad one.

---

## The Power-Interest Grid

Map every stakeholder to a quadrant. This determines your engagement strategy.

---

## Power-Interest: Definitions

**High Power, High Interest** — Decision makers, sponsors → Manage closely

**High Power, Low Interest** — Execs with veto power → Keep satisfied

**Low Power, High Interest** — SMEs, ICs → Keep informed

**Low Power, Low Interest** — Tangential teams → Monitor

**Mistake:** Treating everyone the same.

---

## Champions & Blockers

Beyond the grid, identify:

**Champions:** Who actively wants this to succeed?
- They'll advocate in meetings you're not in
- They'll provide air cover when things get political

**Blockers:** Who might resist?
- **Why** do they resist? (Budget? Ego? Workload? Past failures?)
- Understanding motivation enables mitigation

---

## Common Blocker Motivations

**Threatens budget** — Frame as reallocation, not cut

**Threatens credibility** — Private preview, collaborative framing

**Creates work** — Show ROI, offer phased approach

**Past failures** — Involve in methodology, conservative estimates

**Ego/ownership** — Solicit input, share credit

---

## Exercise: Map Your Stakeholders

> **Think (2 min):**
>
> For one of yesterday's example analyses (Funnel, Attribution, Retention, etc.), who would be in each quadrant?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Give 2 min to think, then cold-call 2-3 students.
Example for Quickcart Funnel Analysis:
- High Power, High Interest: VP Product, CFO
- High Power, Low Interest: CEO
- Low Power, High Interest: Checkout PM, Mobile team
- Low Power, Low Interest: Warehouse ops
-->

---

## Stakeholder Management: Key Takeaways

1. **Map stakeholders to Power-Interest grid** — different strategies per quadrant
2. **Identify champions and blockers** — understand *why* blockers resist
3. **Pre-brief uncomfortable findings** — never ambush in meetings
4. **Tailor communication by quadrant** — executives ≠ ICs
5. **Politics is part of the job** — technical correctness isn't enough

---

# Part 2: Processing Fluency
### *(8 minutes)*

---

## The Core Principle

> **"The more work your listener must do, the less they will trust it."**

This is **processing fluency** — the ease with which information is understood.

High fluency → Feels true, trustworthy
Low fluency → Feels suspicious, questionable

**Your job:** Make it easy for people to understand and believe your findings.

---

<!-- _footer: '' -->

![bg contain](../figures/images/block_05_fluency_comparison.png)

---

## Why Simple Beats Complex

**Research shows:**
- Simple explanations are rated as more credible
- Jargon reduces persuasion (even with expert audiences)
- Visual clarity increases agreement

Complex ≠ Rigorous. Complex = Hard to trust.

---

## Fluency in Practice

| Low Fluency | High Fluency |
|-------------|--------------|
| "The coefficient on the interaction term between channel and cohort was significant at p<0.05 controlling for..." | "Paid social users from Q3 retained 20% worse than Q2." |
| Dense tables with 15 columns | Highlighted key numbers with context |
| 40-slide appendix | 10 slides + "details available" |

**Rule:** If an executive can't understand it in 30 seconds, simplify.

---

## The Fluency Test

Before presenting, ask:

1. **Can I explain this in one sentence?**
2. **Would my non-technical friend understand?**
3. **What's the ONE number that matters?**
4. **Is everything else supporting detail?**

If you can't pass this test, you're not ready to present.

---

## Message Theory Cheat-Sheet

**Before any communication, complete this sentence:**

> "I'm presenting to **[specific person]** about **[topic in 10 words]** and my recommendation is **[specific action]**."

**Who?** A specific person, not "the team" → *"Sarah, the CFO"*

**What?** Topic in 10 words → *"Where should we spend next quarter?"*

**So what?** A specific action → *"Shift $200K from paid social to referral"*

**If you can't fill in this sentence, you're not ready to present.**

# Part 4: Four Influence Strategies
### *(30 minutes)*

---

<!-- _header: '' -->
<!-- _footer: '' -->

![bg contain](../figures/images/block_05_influence_compass.png)

---

## The Influence Compass

Four strategies, four directions. Each works differently.

Your stakeholder map determines which strategy to use with whom.

---

## Strategy 1: Authority (North)

**What it is:** Leveraging support from people with organizational power.

**How it sounds:**
> "The VP of Product has reviewed this approach and supports moving forward."
> "Leadership asked us to prioritize this."

**When to use:**
- Stakeholder respects hierarchy
- You have genuine top-down support
- Decision needs organizational weight

---

## Authority: How to Build It

You probably don't have inherent authority. So:

1. **Get a sponsor** — Find a leader who supports your work
2. **Secure explicit endorsement** — "Can I say you've reviewed this?"
3. **Cite the ask** — "This was requested by [leader]"

**Warning:** Don't fake authority. Being caught undermines everything.

---

## Strategy 2: Credibility (South)

**What it is:** Leveraging validation from respected experts or peers.

**How it sounds:**
> "The senior data scientist reviewed the methodology and confirmed it's sound."
> "Engineering validated that this is technically feasible."

**When to use:**
- Stakeholder is technical or detail-oriented
- Your personal credibility isn't established yet
- The methodology is complex or novel

---

## Credibility: How to Build It

1. **Get peer review** — Have respected ICs review your work
2. **Cite precedent** — "This is the same approach Airbnb used for..."
3. **Show your work** — Make methodology transparent and available
4. **Acknowledge limitations** — Credible people admit uncertainty

**Warning:** Over-claiming expertise you don't have destroys credibility permanently.

---

## Strategy 3: Social Proof (West)

**What it is:** Leveraging data about what others do or believe.

**How it sounds:**
> "73% of users said they'd upgrade if we added this feature."
> "Industry benchmarks show 3:1 LTV:CAC is healthy; we're at 1.5:1."
> "Three other companies in our space have already made this change."

**When to use:**
- Stakeholder is risk-averse
- Decision feels uncertain
- You have relevant data or benchmarks

---

## Social Proof: How to Build It

1. **Survey data** — What do users/customers actually say?
2. **Industry benchmarks** — What do peers do?
3. **Internal precedent** — "We did something similar for X product"
4. **Competitive intelligence** — What are competitors doing?

**Warning:** Cherry-picked social proof backfires. Be honest about what the data shows.

---

## Strategy 4: Consistency (East)

**What it is:** Connecting your recommendation to stated priorities.

**How it sounds:**
> "This aligns with our Q2 priority of improving retention."
> "The CEO said at all-hands that profitability is the focus this year."
> "This supports the roadmap item we already committed to."

**When to use:**
- Stakeholder has stated priorities or values
- Organization has clear strategy
- You can draw genuine connection

---

## Consistency: How to Build It

1. **Know the roadmap** — What has leadership committed to?
2. **Quote back priorities** — "You mentioned [X] was important..."
3. **Show alignment** — Make the connection explicit
4. **Avoid contradictions** — Don't recommend things that conflict with stated goals

**Warning:** Forced connections feel manipulative. The alignment must be genuine.

---

## Choosing Your Strategy

**Authority (N)** — For hierarchy-respecting stakeholders. Requires sponsor support.

**Credibility (S)** — For technical/skeptical stakeholders. Requires peer validation.

**Social Proof (W)** — For risk-averse stakeholders. Requires data, benchmarks.

**Consistency (E)** — For strategy-focused stakeholders. Requires knowledge of priorities.

**Most presentations use 2-3 strategies combined.**

---

## Example: MindfulApp Recommendation

Recommendation: "Shift $200K from paid social to referral program"

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Authority** | "The CEO asked us to find a path to profitability" |
| **Credibility** | "Finance validated our CAC calculations" |
| **Social Proof** | "Industry benchmark is 3:1 LTV:CAC; we're at 1.2x on paid social" |
| **Consistency** | "This aligns with our Series B milestone of positive unit economics" |

---

## Exercise: Strategy Selection

> **Think (2 min):**
>
> You need to convince a skeptical CFO to approve a $500K investment in a referral program.
>
> Which 2 strategies would you lead with? Why?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Cold call 2-3 students.
Strong answer: Social Proof (ROI benchmarks, other companies' results) + Consistency (aligns with profitability goals)
CFOs often respond to data and financial alignment more than authority.
-->

---

## The Wrong Strategy Backfires

- **Technical expert** + Authority → *"Show me the math"*
- **Senior executive** + Excessive detail → *"I don't have time"*
- **Risk-averse PM** + Novelty framing → *"Too risky"*
- **Data-driven leader** + Anecdotes only → *"Where's the evidence?"*

**Know your audience.** The wrong strategy is worse than no strategy.

# Part 5: Stakeholder-Strategy Integration
### *(12 minutes)*

---

## Stakeholder Map → Influence Strategy

Your Power-Interest Grid tells you **what to communicate**.

Your influence strategy tells you **how to communicate it**.

| Quadrant | Likely Effective Strategies |
|----------|----------------------------|
| High Power, High Interest | Authority + Consistency |
| High Power, Low Interest | Authority + Social Proof (efficiency) |
| Low Power, High Interest | Credibility + Social Proof |
| Low Power, Low Interest | Minimal engagement needed |

---

## Champions: How to Arm Them

Champions advocate for you in rooms you're not in.

**Give them:**
1. **The one-sentence summary** — What they'll say when asked
2. **The killer stat** — The number that makes the case
3. **Anticipated objections + responses** — So they can defend
4. **Your recommendation clearly** — So they don't misrepresent

---

## Blockers: How to Neutralize Them

Blockers resist. Understand why:

| Motivation | Strategy |
|------------|----------|
| **Threatens their budget** | Show mutual benefit, or acknowledge tradeoff |
| **Threatens their credibility** | Private conversation, collaborative framing |
| **Creates work for them** | Offer to help, phase the approach |
| **Past bad experience** | Acknowledge history, show what's different |

**Pre-brief blockers privately.** Never surprise them in a meeting.

---

## The Pre-Brief Framework

Before any major presentation:

1. **Identify who might be uncomfortable**
2. **Schedule 15-min 1:1** — "I want to get your input before the meeting"
3. **Share key findings** — No surprises
4. **Solicit feedback** — "What am I missing?"
5. **Incorporate reasonable feedback** — Shows you listened
6. **In the meeting** — They're prepared, not ambushed

This transforms blockers into (at worst) neutrals.

---

## Example: DataDash Attribution

**Scenario:** You're recommending $600K shift from Paid Search to LinkedIn.

**Blocker:** Paid Search manager (budget cut = career threat)

**Pre-brief approach:**
- Meet privately before presentation
- Frame: "I want to understand your perspective"
- Share findings early
- Ask: "What am I missing about how Search contributes?"
- Incorporate valid points
- In meeting: "As [name] and I discussed, there are tradeoffs here..."

# Part 6: Influence Planning Exercise
### *(15 minutes)*

---

## The Exercise

**Scenario:** You've completed a retention analysis for SnapGram showing that D7 retention dropped because the new onboarding flow is too aggressive.

**Your recommendation:** Simplify onboarding (remove mandatory friend-adding step).

**The problem:** The Growth PM who designed the new onboarding flow will be in the presentation. Their promotion case cited this launch.

---

## Think (3 min)

> 1. What's your topic in 10 words?
> 2. What's your specific recommendation?
> 3. What influence strategies will you use?
> 4. How will you handle the Growth PM (blocker)?

Write down your answers.

---

## Pair (5 min)

> Share your approach with a partner.
>
> Challenge each other:
> - Is the recommendation specific enough?
> - Will the influence strategy work for this audience?
> - Is the blocker mitigation realistic?

---

## Share (10 min)

> **Groups share approaches:**
>
> Let's hear 3-4 different approaches to this scenario.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Looking for:
- Topic: "Why retention dropped and how to fix it"
- Recommendation: "Remove mandatory friend-adding, A/B test simplified flow"
- Strategies: Credibility (data), Social Proof (correlation with retention drop), Consistency (retention is company priority)
- Blocker: Pre-brief, frame as "learning" not "failure", acknowledge their other contributions

Push back on weak approaches. Ask "What if the Growth PM pushes back with...?"
-->

---

## Debrief: What Makes Influence Work

1. **Know your audience** — One person, not "the team"
2. **Have a clear recommendation** — Specific action
3. **Choose strategies based on stakeholder** — Not one-size-fits-all
4. **Pre-brief blockers** — Never surprise
5. **Make it easy to understand** — Processing fluency

Influence isn't manipulation. It's clear communication + stakeholder awareness.

---

## Block 5 Summary

| Concept | Key Takeaway |
|---------|--------------|
| **Processing Fluency** | Simple beats complex; make it easy to trust |
| **Message Theory** | Audience + Topic + Recommendation (all specific) |
| **Four Strategies** | Authority, Credibility, Social Proof, Consistency |
| **Stakeholder Connection** | Grid tells you what; strategy tells you how |
| **Blockers** | Pre-brief privately; never surprise |

---

## Questions?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Take 2-3 questions.
Common Q: "What if I don't have authority or credibility?"
A: Build it through the other strategies first. Social proof and consistency don't require seniority.
