## 1. Search Update

[Draft your update here: What's happened since Week 1? Any new leads? Closed doors? What's your current status?]


## 2. Project Evaluation

### Potential Project 1: [Project Name]

| Red Flag | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Can they articulate the business question? | [Yes/No/Partial] |
| Is data available? When? | [Details] |
| Is there a named sponsor? | [Name/Role] |
| What decisions will this inform? | [Decision] |
| Is the sponsor engaged or "too busy"? | [Observation] |

**Promise level:** [Evaluation of how promising this project is based on the above.]

## 3. Scope Negotiations

[Draft your negotiation details here: Have you had any conversations about scope? What did the sponsor initially want vs. what's feasible? How did you (or will you) negotiate?]

## 4. Plan B

[Draft your backup plan here: If your current leads fall through, what's your backup? When is your personal deadline to have a project locked in?]

## 5. Messy Situation Practice

> "The data is definitely available, we just need to work out access with IT. Should be ready in a few weeks, maybe a month. Let's not let that slow us down."

[Draft your response here: Is this a red flag? What questions would you ask? What would make you walk away?]

## 6. Reflection

[Draft your reflection here: What's the most important lesson you've learned about finding a good capstone project?]
