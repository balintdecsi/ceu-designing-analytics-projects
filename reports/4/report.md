## 1. Search Update

Up to now, I've mostly been reaching out to people in my network. Honestly, a top experience for me regarding this is finding out how many managers and teams are open to collaboration, which has had a good effect on my confidence. Obviously, this is due to the fact that I offer to do the analysis for free, but either way I've talked with people I'd otherwise consider less approachable.\
Nonetheless, I find it difficult to close a possible opportunity or ask the *important* and often uncomfortable questions that shed light on red flags.\

## 2. Project Evaluation

### Potential Project 1: Climate Risk Clssification for Budapest District Building Blocks

| Red Flag | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Can they articulate the business question? | Yes |
| Is data available? When? | Yes, public and purchased, immediately |
| Is there a named sponsor? | Yes, team lead of Environmental Dept. |
| What decisions will this inform? | Partially defined -- long-term climate diguidelines of district municipality. |
| Is the sponsor engaged or "too busy"? | Engaged. |

**Promise level:** This project will be promising if a clear business outcome is defined. Contact person and stakeholder relations are guaranteed. Analytics task is clear: create a *v2* classifcation model instead of the *v1* regression model.

### Potential Project 2: Building Roof Rainwater Capture Capacity Interpolation 

| Red Flag | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Can they articulate the business question? | Yes |
| Is data available? When? | Yes, public and purchased, immediately |
| Is there a named sponsor? | Yes, research group head at Budapest University of Technology and Economics |
| What decisions will this inform? | Size of water reservoir tanks that would be installed in the future |
| Is the sponsor engaged or "too busy"? | Engaged. |

**Promise level:** I'm possibly ruling this out because as far as I've understood, the dataset is small (around 1000 rows). The outcome decision is clear, maybe the clearest of all potential projects, but I fear it would be used for informative purposes as the analysis user is a research group, possibly lacking the actual executive power. I'm also worried about the level of analytics required, as it's been mentioned by the stakeholder researcher that in his opinion, an "interpolation would suffice".

### Potential Project 3: Car Traffic Incident Effect Ecosystem Analysis 

| Red Flag | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Can they articulate the business question? | Yes |
| Is data available? When? | Yes, public and purchased, immediately |
| Is there a named sponsor? | Yes, innovation project manager at BKK (the Budapest public transport company) |
| What decisions will this inform? | Fine-tuning of traffic lights and efficiently re-routing traffic in peak hours and in case of incidents |
| Is the sponsor engaged or "too busy"? |  |

**Promise level:** I'm possibly ruling this out because as far as I've understood, the dataset is small (around 1000 rows). The outcome decision is clear, maybe the clearest of all potential projects, but I fear it would be used for informative purposes as the analysis user is a research group, possibly lacking the actual executive power. I'm also worried about the level of analytics required, as it's been mentioned by the stakeholder researcher that in his opinion, an "interpolation would suffice".



## 3. Scope Negotiations

[Draft your negotiation details here: Have you had any conversations about scope? What did the sponsor initially want vs. what's feasible? How did you (or will you) negotiate?]

## 4. Plan B

[Draft your backup plan here: If your current leads fall through, what's your backup? When is your personal deadline to have a project locked in?]

## 5. Messy Situation Practice

> "The data is definitely available, we just need to work out access with IT. Should be ready in a few weeks, maybe a month. Let's not let that slow us down."

[Draft your response here: Is this a red flag? What questions would you ask? What would make you walk away?]

## 6. Reflection

[Draft your reflection here: What's the most important lesson you've learned about finding a good capstone project?]

*Before submitting: What decision would your capstone drive? What could break if it succeeds?*
