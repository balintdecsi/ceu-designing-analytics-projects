## Week 4: Evaluating Project Opportunities (Due: Feb 13)

### Prompt

Update on your capstone search and evaluate potential projects.

**Your submission should include:**

1. **Search Update**
   - What's happened since Week 1?
   - Any new leads? Closed doors?
   - What's your current status?

2. **Project Evaluation (1-2 potential projects)**
   - For each project you're considering, evaluate against the "red flags" checklist:

     | Red Flag | Status |
     |----------|--------|
     | Can they articulate the business question? | |
     | Is data available? When? | |
     | Is there a named sponsor? | |
     | What decisions will this inform? | |
     | Is the sponsor engaged or "too busy"? | |

   - Based on this evaluation, how promising is each project?

3. **Scope Negotiations**
   - Have you had any conversations about scope?
   - What did the sponsor initially want vs. what's feasible?
   - How did you (or will you) negotiate?

4. **Plan B**
   - If your current leads fall through, what's your backup?
   - When is your personal deadline to have a project locked in?

5. **Messy Situation Practice**
   > One of your potential sponsors says: "The data is definitely available, we just need to work out access with IT. Should be ready in a few weeks, maybe a month. Let's not let that slow us down."

   Is this a red flag? What questions would you ask? What would make you walk away?

**Reflection:** What's the most important lesson you've learned about finding a good capstone project?

*Before submitting: What decision would your capstone drive? What could break if it succeeds?*
