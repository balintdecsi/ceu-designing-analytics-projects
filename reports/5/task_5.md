## Week 5: Pre-Mortem on a Hypothetical (Due: Feb 20)

### Prompt

Practice the pre-mortem exercise on a project you're NOT doing.

**Your task:**

Choose one of the following:
- One of the scenarios from the class assignment
- A potential capstone project you decided NOT to pursue
- A hypothetical project based on your work experience

**Your submission should include:**

1. **Project Summary**
   - 2-3 sentences describing the project, sponsor, and goal

2. **The Pre-Mortem Narrative**
   - Imagine it's 6 months from now. The project failed.
   - Write 2-3 paragraphs telling the story of what went wrong
   - Be specific: What happened? What was the root cause?
   - Include at least one of:
     - Correlation/causation confusion
     - Stakeholder dynamics gone wrong
     - Scope creep
     - Data quality issues
     - Metric gaming
     - **The data turned out to be garbage** (missing, inconsistent, or unusable)
     - **The sponsor went dark** (stopped responding, left company, lost interest)

3. **What Should Have Been Done Differently?**
   - Looking back at your failure story, what interventions could have prevented it?
   - Be specific

4. **How This Informs Your Capstone**
   - What will you do differently in your actual capstone because of this exercise?
   - What risks will you watch for?

**Reflection:** What did the pre-mortem reveal that you hadn't considered before writing it?

*Before submitting: What decision would your capstone drive? What could break if it succeeds?*
