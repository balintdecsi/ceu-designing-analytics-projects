   - Provide the link or source
   - Summarize what happened in 2-3 sentences

2. **Apply the "What Breaks" Framework**
   - What was the primary metric they were optimizing?
   - What directly worsened as a result?
   - What quality degraded?
   - Which user segments were harmed?
   - What long-term metrics suffered?

3. **What Counter-Metrics Should They Have Tracked?**
   - Identify 2-3 counter-metrics that could have caught the problem
   - Label each as Guardrail or Tradeoff
   - What threshold should have triggered concern?

4. **Personal Connection**
   - Have you seen something similar at work or in your experience?
   - How does this change how you'll think about metrics in your capstone?
